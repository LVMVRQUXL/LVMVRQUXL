### Hello world üëã

I‚Äôm a software engineer based in Paris.

My favorite programming language is [Kotlin].
I‚Äôm interested in a lot of programming topics like functional and intentional
programming.
In my opinion, the perfect system isn't one to which nothing can be added, but
one to which nothing can be taken away.

Feel free to reach me by mail: [loiclamarque777@gmail.com].
